/*
 * The repository field is a dependency of the service class. This means that
 * our service class depends on this field for something. Dependencies aren't
 * necessarily a bad thing are required sometimes. Even so, dependencies can make
 * testing an application trickier, particularly unit testing.
 *
 * Recall that a unit test should be a minimal test focusing on one and
 * only component. We want to test the smallest unit that we possibly can
 * test.
 *
 * Layman's Terms: When you run a unit test, you should know exactly which
 * component is failing. If you do not, you probably could write a better
 * test.
